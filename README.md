Overview of the Project
The Projectile Tracker project calculates and plots the motion of any projectile based on user-provided inputs. The user chooses the initial launch velocity (meters per second), initial launch height (meters), and launch angle (in degrees above the horizontal). These inputs are used in a series of calculations found in the Projectile Functions branch to determine the projectile’s time of flight, horizontal range, and maximum height. The code simultaneously generates a visual plot based on the user inputs for the projectile’s trajectory using the Python library MATPLOTLIB, allowing the user to see the path of the projectile over time.
Features of the Project
The code calculates these properties of the projectile:
Time of Flight – total time the projectile remains in the air
Maximum Height – highest vertical position reached
Horizontal Range – total horizontal distance traveled
Position at a Given Time – x and y coordinates during flight
Velocity at a Given Time – horizontal and vertical velocity components

Along with that the code also accomplishes:
Taking user inputs and generating the nonlinear trajectory of the projectile
Plotting the path of the projectile using MATPLOTLIB
Project Components
The Projectile Tracker Project is made up of two python files, the main code and the function library.

Projectile-Tracker.py (the main code) is designed to do these things:
Collect user inputs
Call calculation functions
Generate the trajectory points
Plotting the projectile motion graph

Projectile_Functions.py (the function library) contains these functions:
Projectile Setup
Nonlinear Trajectory
Time of Flight
Horizontal Range
Max Height
Position at Time
Velocity at Time
Example Code Output
Graph:

User Inputs:
Velocity: 43.5 m/s
Launch Height: 7 m
Launch Angle (degrees about the horizontal): 30°
Physics Model
This project models projectile motion assuming:
Gravity = 9.81 m/s^2
There is no air resistance
Two dimensional motion

The trajectory is calculated by using this equation:
y =xtan()-gx22v2cos2()+h 
Where:
v  = initial launch velocity
Θ = launch angle
h  = launch height
g  = gravity
